# eldenring-eac-bypass-json
## What it is:
This is simply a modified version of the `settings.json` file which is found at the `...\ELDEN RING\Game\EasyAntiCheat\` directory. The values which are modifed are the `"productid"`, `"sandboxid"`, and `"deploymentid"`. The effect this produces allows the user to go online in-game while EasyAntiCheat is not functional, allowing for online use of modifications as well as programs like Cheat Engine. This works up through the current game patch of **1.03.3**.
This effect can be reproduced with any number of values set for `"productid"`, `"sandboxid"`, and `"deploymentid"`. They simply need to be changed to something else, which can be any value you choose. In my uploaded .json file I simply chose to place *0* as the value for each field.
